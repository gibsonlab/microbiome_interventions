# Microbiome Intervention Analysis

This repository includes scripts for reproducing simulation experiments in "mbtransfer: Microbiome Intervention Analysis using Transfer Functions and Mirror Statistics." Two of the sub-directories (`mdsine` and `fido`) wrap the baseline methods discussed in the paper, so that they all use a consistent interface. `tfPaper` includes data generation code, and `cluster` sets up the CHTC environment for experiments.
